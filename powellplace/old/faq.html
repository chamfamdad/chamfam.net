		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		
		<h2>Who is Clayman Property Services?</h2>
		<p>
			The Association of Powell Place Home Owners has reached an agreement and retained the Services of Clayman Property Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clayman Property Services will be able to help manage the bookkeeping, expenses, billing, and collections of dues as well as
			a host of other duties.

		</p>

		<h2>Why do we pay dues?</h2>
		<p>
			The Association of Powell Place Home Owners depends solely on dues from member homeowners for all its
			operational funds.  The single largest expense is for lawn care around the entrances and the pond.
			The pond is the next largest expense.  Money is spent on electricity and maintenance of the pump.
		</p>

		<h2>When are we billed for dues?</h2>
		<p>
			Homeowners should expect a bill for dues sometime in February after the annual meeting.  Prompt
			payment of your homeowner's fees is appreciated and minimizes any consternation for both the
			association board and the property owner.  Questions regarding your homeowner's association dues
			or account status may be directed to Clayman Property Services.

		<h2>What is architectural review?</h2>
		<p>
			All architectural changes that are covered under your home's covenants (you should have received these when
			you bought your home; or you can view these <a href="information.html">here</a>) need to be reviewed
			and approved by the Association. The city will not grant a permit without a preliminary approval from the Association. 
			Please contact Clayman Property Services if you have any proposed changes or additions i.e. including but not limited 
			to installing fences, changes in paint coloring of the home, patios, decks, etc.
		</p>

		<h2>Can I write an article for the newsletter?</h2>
		<p>
			The Association accepts short articles and notices for publication in the newsletter from members.  The Association
			Board reserves the right to review, reject, and edit all material and cannot guarantee publication or accuracy.
			Submit your information to anyone serving on the board.
		</p>

		<h2>Can I water my lawn?</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.delcowater.com">Del-Co Water Company</a> sets the watering restrictions.  For the past few years there have
			been watering restrictions.  Please check Del-Co Water's web site for more information.
		</p>

		<h2>Where can I recycle?</h2>
		<p>
			The <a href="http://www.cityofpowell.us/">City of Powell</a> has contracted with Rumpke for curb side recycling pickup.  Please see
			Rumpke's web site for <a href="http://www.rumpke.com/Recycling/FAQ.asp">more information</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Pets</h2>
		<p>
			The APPHO Board of Trustees has received several complaints about stray
			cats and dogs running loose through the neighborhood. While the homeowners association does not
			have the authority to monitor or manage stray animals in the neighborhood they have been in contact with the
			City of Powell and the Delaware county dog warden.  They have suggested that we contact them directly if we
			encounter pets that are roaming free.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Powell police department may be contacted by phone using their nonemergency telephone number of 614-885-3374.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dog warden may be contacted by phone at 740-368-1915 or by email at <a href="mailto:dogwarden@co.delaware.oh.us">dogwarden@co.delaware.oh.us</a>

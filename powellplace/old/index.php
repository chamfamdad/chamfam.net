		<h2 class="sub-header">Unified Declarations</h2>
		<p>
			The board has been working with the Association’s attorneys, Kaman & Cusimano, to assist with drafting a set of unified Declarations. 
			The unified Declarations will:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Make the Declarations for all of the phases in the neighborhood as uniform as possible and will provide continuity between the phases</li>
			<li>Help preserve property values in a single, streamlined set of documents that govern the Association</li>
			<li>Eliminates unnecessary references in the Declarations</li>
			<li>Restricts County Sheriff-notified Tier III and Tier II sex offenders from being able to reside in our community</li>
			<li>Be consistent with Ohio’s “Planned Community” laws</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Homeowners should have received a packet of information about this effort.  Items included in the packet were:

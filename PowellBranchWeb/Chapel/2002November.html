   <h3>Friday, November 29, 2002</h3>

   Obviously there was no work done yesterday (and it's actually against the law to work on a holiday in Powell).

   <P>

   Today they began putting on the vapor barrier.  They also had to redo some of the tar paper on the roof because the wind was blowing it off.

<h3>Thursday, November 22, 2002</h3>

There are now lights inside the building (although temporary).  So somehow they got electricity inside.  I saw the electric company working on
a transformer down the street earlier this week.  I guess that is what was needed for electricity.

Today they continued on the roof, until it sprinkled, and then they all got down.  You never want to be on a wet roof.
I don't know if it will dry out enough to continue work or not.

<P>
They did finish the tar paper before having to get off.

They were able to complete the roof deck yesterday.  And today they began with the tar paper.  I was surprised to see them start
on that without finishing the dormers first.  I guess there is a lot of roof that you can shingle without getting in the way of the dormers.

going on inside.

Because they did not shingle the out building, the tar paper has blown off.  They will now have to redo the tar paper on the out building.

The outside of the building is taking shape.  More underlayment was placed on the front of the building.  But they still need to replace
a few walls before the front will be done.

<h3>Wednesday, November 6, 2002</h3>

I think they have been placing a studs inside the rafters over the past few days.  And since it is inside, I can't see what they are doing.

<P>

Does the roof look crooked to you?  Maybe the photo is just at the wrong angle?  I don't know, but it looks crooked to me.  Actually,
maybe they just aren't finished with this side yet.  The other side has a board across the face that would straighten it up a bit.

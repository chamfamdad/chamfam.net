Most of the underlayment on the front wall was put up today.  That means that most of the outside walls of the entire building has underlayment.

<h3>Monday, October 28, 2002</h3>

Sorry I didn't get a photo last Friday.  It rained most of the day so I wasn't able to get over there.  Before the rain began, the workers
were able to place a few boards on the front wall of the chapel.
<P>
Today, I didn't notice much of a difference from Friday.  I did see the workers there working, but I could not tell what work was compeleted.

<h3>Thursday, October 24, 2002</h3>

They continued working on the rafters today.  Most of the north side of the building was completed.  Now I think they will begin work on the dormers.

<P>

Something funny I noticed today is that from a distance, the rafters look like a stealth bomber.  The top picture on the right demonstrates this effect the best.

<h3>23 October 2002</h3>

They continued working on the rafters today.

<P>

They were also spraying the rafters today.  I am not sure if they were washing them, or treating them with something.
Though, from the smell in the area, I am guessing it was insecticide.

Wow, there were some noticable improvements today!  They started on the roof.
<P>
They also added some framing for the entry way on either side of the building.

<h3>16 October 2002</h3>

Today I saw them working on the ceilings in the class rooms and the hallways.  By doing this they are helping to support the walls in the chapel.
Then, when the chapel walls are strong enough, they can start the roof trusses (though we could still be a week or more away on that).

There was definitely work done today.  The tall walls on the sides of the chapel were put up.
They also spread gravel around the parking lot in preparation for the asphalt.

It was hard to tell if there was any work done today.  Maybe they worked on the parking lot.  It seemed a little smoother.  Or maybe they had Columbus Day off?

Today they starting covering the outside walls.  This will strengthen them so thay can put the rafters on (though we are still a long way away
from being ready for the rafters).

I also noticed some grading in the parking lot.

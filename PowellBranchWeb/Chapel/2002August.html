<h3>30 August 2002</h3>

<P>

I thought more about the foundation today, and I think the exterior walls they set up yesterday are for the fence around the
mechanical equipment that sits outside.  Anyway, they poured that foundation today, as well as places for the outside light
poles.

<P>
<I>18 September 2002...Now that I have seen the drawings again, I realized that it was not the foundation for the light poles.
It was the footer for the four columns for the entry ways on either side of the buidling.</I>

There must be some more cement to pour around the foundation.  They have again set up forms around the building like they
are getting ready to pour some new footers.  Maybe the walls that are currently poured are actually inside walls.  I don't
know for sure.  I am only guessing since I have not seen a set of plans.

Work continued on the insualtion around the foundation.  They were also doing alot of digging, trying to bury pipes, etc. for the utilities
inside the building.

They are in the process of getting the floor ready for cement.  They were digging for utilities today.  Also, I see they started with the foam
insulation around the edge of the building.

All of the cement forms from around the foundation have been removed.  I also saw them preparing some wooden forms around items in the
center of the building.  This will allow them to pour the floor and leave small openings for the utilities.  These voids in the floor will
be filled in later when the utilities have been finalized.

Work continued on the south wall.  Many of the forms had been removed.  I also noticed some other ground work in the center of the building

can get the floor poured.

They poured concrete in the south wall today.  Given the forecast for rain tomorrow through the weekend, it's a good thing it got done today.

Today they removed the concrete forms from the north half of the chapel.  I believe they removed them completely
from the job site, because I didn't notice a huge pile of them.  However, the forms along the southern wall, are
still in place.  In fact, I believe they still have not poured the concrete for the south wall.  Check the picture
on the left for yourself and make your own judgement.

<h3>19 August 2002</h3>

<P>

I guess the work on the foundation takes much longer than I expected.  Or, it just seems that way when you measure the progress
every day.  As I drove by this morning I did see them out working on the south wall.  I don't know if the rain today hampered their
progress, but it was hard to notice any changes since last Friday.

It's getting harder and harder to tell what work has been accomplished since the previous day. It appears that work

<h3>15 August 2002</h3>

When I went by at lunch time today they were just covering over a trench.  I guess that it is
for some of the utitlies, though I couldn't tell where the trench came out to the street.  I could only see where it
went diaganol across the front lawn and ended up near the nortwest corner of the chapel.

<P>

They also began moving the concrete forms to the south side of the chapel.  That
means the foundation must be done on the north wall of the chapel.

There was no work done over the weekend and I did not notice any activity today.

Today I noticed some concrete had been poured in some of the footers.
Though as I looked back over the photos from yesterday, they may have actually done that work then.

In the photo on the right you can see some rebar sticking up out of the footers.  They all have
orange caps sticking on the end.

I get the feeling that the recurring theme for the next few days is "they are working on the footers".
They started placing the concrete forms around the footers today. The construction trailer also arived, though
I forgot to take a picture of it.

<P>
In case you were wondering... The footers are the foundation.

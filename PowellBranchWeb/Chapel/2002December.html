   Today I got a good look at the bricks.  The back of the building has been done, or is almost done.
   <P>
   The plumbers were on the roof installing the sewer vents.

   <h3>Friday, December 13, 2002</h3>
   Again it was still too wet to be on the roof.
   <P>
   I did notice preparations for doing the brick work.  They have placed plastic around the outside of the back of the building.  This will
   allow them to run space heaters and warm up the outside wall.  Cement has a difficult time curing in the cold, so the heat is needed to
   help the mortar cure.

<h3>30 September 2002</h3>

They poured the concrete floor in the middle third of the building today.  I also noticed a utility trench that had been worked on that came
out to the road.

<h3>26-28 September 2002</h3>

I was out of town for a few days, so I did not get to drive by the chapel.  However, my brother went by and took a few pictures.
As I look over the site, nothing new strikes my memory.  Maybe the rain scared them off for a couple of days.

<h3>25 September 2002</h3>

About two thirds of the floor was poured today.  They also worked on both entrances, laying the drainage pipe and then covering with rocks
so they can pour the asphalt on top.

<h3>24 September 2002</h3>

Today as I was watching them level the hole where the font would be, the truck with the font showed up.

<P>

They also worked hard on the rebar.  Most of the building looks like it has the rebar in place for the concrete.  The only area I noticed that
was missing was the bathrooms.

<h3>23 September 2002</h3>

They worked on the rebar for the floor today.  It seems that most of the middle section of the building has the rebar in place.  None
of the classrooms have been prepared.

<h3>20 September 2002</h3>

When Marie went by today she saw them dumping some gravel.  As I looked over the site, it appears that the center of the building has had
the gravel spread out so that they can pour the cement.

The framers were there again today putting together pieces of walls.  The plumber was also there today still running water and sewer lines
in the floor.

<h3>18 September 2002</h3>

While we do not yet have a floor, we do have a storage building.  The framers put together the out building today.

<P>

I also went by at lunch to see what they were working on.  They are still running utilities throughout the floor of the building.  I watched
as they ran some of the sewer lines (guessing by the size of the pipe).

We now know the name of the contractor, <a href="http://www.apexconstruction.com/">APEX M & P Construction LLC</a>.  It looks like they have
built quite a few large buildings in the area.

<h3>16 September 2002</h3>

I could not tell what work had been done today.  I am not able to see the small detail that must be happening to get ready for the floor from
accross the street.  I expect to see the floor go in any day now, though.  I can't believe they want the framing wood laying around too
long without putting it up.

<h3>13 September 2002</h3>

Today I noticed a small brick wall right in front of the construction trailer.  It seems too small for our sign out front.  But on the
other hand, what else would it be?  I guess we shall wait and see if it turns out to be a sign for the chapel.

No floor yet, but there is still plenty of activity going on.  They were digging trenches for what looked like the sewer line.

The framers continued framing today.  But they had no where to put the walls because the floor is still not in.  They just stacked them off
to the side.

I also saw them digging where I expected the baptismal font to be.  Guess we will see soon enough.

<h3>10 September 2002</h3>

<P>

The construction crew seems eager to get started framing the building.  Today a whole bunch of lumber showed up at the chapel.  I even watched
them construct a few walls.  They walls are not up yet because they still have not poured the floor.  Hopefully we will see the floor in the next
few days.

</a>
I also noticed a man standing in a large hole in the ground in the middle of the building.  It took me a minute to decide that he could
have been standing where the baptismal font will be.  However, it was in a part of the building where I didn't think the font was going.
I hope I can somehow get a floor plan of the building so I can tell where things are supposed to be.
<P>
<I>18 September 2002...I have now seen the floor plan.
He was indeed standing where the baptismal font will be.</I>

Sorry I didn't get a picture last night.  I had too many things to do before the BYU football
game.  And I didn't get a chance to get the picture.
<P>
I can see they worked some on the storm
drains for the parking lot.  It looks as if they installed some of the drains on the north
side of the chapel.

Today was one of those days where I really didn't notice any work.  Except for the fact that the yellow caution tape appeard today.  Centrainly,
they did more work than that.  I just couldn't tell from across the street.

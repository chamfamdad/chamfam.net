      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>
        Don't worry about how much chicken broth or bullion, just use water and then add as much bullion as needed to taste.  You also
        don't have to bother to grill the chicken.  Just throw it in the soup and let it boil.  No cream? No problem.  Use less water and
        stir in milk instead.

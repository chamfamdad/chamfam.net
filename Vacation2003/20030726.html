			After breakfast we returned to Wal-Mart for a few more things and then met up with even
			more family at Grandma and Grandpa Hatch's hotel.  George and Debbie Nowland and James and Carin Nowland along
			with Ron Huntzinger were all there.</td>

			Debbie and George had spoken with someone on the plane and he had recommended a restaurant in
			the area, so we decided to give it a try.  The name of the restaurant was <a href="http://www.elpinto.com/">El Pinto</a>.
			The food was great.  We had been in New Mexico for days and we finally got a chance to get some good food.</td>

			We stopped at an outdoor garden accessory shop.  They had large (7-8 feet) metal lizards
			that we wanted to look at.  Had the price been right, we would have found a way to get one
			home.</td>

			Bruce and Kelsey's wedding is the main reason we drove 1600 miles.  Their wedding was nice.  They
			even had spectacular special effects.  At all the right times in the ceremony lighting would strike
			(it never rained though).

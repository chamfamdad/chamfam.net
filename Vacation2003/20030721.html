			Pit stop.  We stopped at a rest area in Missouri for a bathroom break.  Fletcher noticed that there was transmission
			fluid bubbling out the front seal (Maybe that would have something to do with the trouble we were having with
			the rolling hills.  The van just couldn't make it going uphill.)

			A quick check of the transmission fluid says we are okay, but the van won't do anything over 55 mph.

		<td>Fletcher exits the toll road at Lawrence, Kansas because the van just isn't working properly and he feels that
			it would not be wise to continue traveling.  We find a library in Lawrence to browse the internet for a new
			vehicle.  We find 4 or 5 vans in the area that might work for our family.  We are going to find a campground
			and unhook the camper so that we might have better luck driving around looking at new vans.

		<td>Not wanting to lose any time for looking at new vans we just drop off the camper at the KOA and
			proceed to look at vans.  We stop and look at a couple in Lawrence, but they are custom vans, which
			don't really suite our purposes.  We then drive back toward Kansas City to look at a 15 passenger
			van.
			<P>
			The drive to Olathe (Suburb of Kansas City) is just as bad as the drive all day.  The van just doesn't
			want to go.  I hope we make it there.
			<P>
			We end up driving a 2002 Ford 15 passenger van and it probably fits our needs the best.  We had also
			been talking with Marie's Dad about Bruce's Ford Excursion (I think it was a 1999).  He is trying to sell it and Marie's Dad
			is willing to drive it out to us.
			<P>
			So at this point, we have two choices, a 15 passenger van (like we are used to, nothing fancy, it just works) or
			a Ford Excursion (that only seats 8 people, and we are used to a lot of space).
			<P>
			We head back to the campground to discuss the options and pick up dinner along the way.  The
			van is having real trouble making it back.  I hope we don't get stranded now.</td>

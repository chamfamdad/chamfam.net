		    It is not an easy thing to gather such a large group and take an outing.  We were supposed
		    to meet Eric and Lydia at their hotel at 10:00 am and then drive together to Mesa Verde.  But
			in an effort to get Bruce and Kelsey to go, we ended up waiting for them at Eric and Lydia's
			hotel.  However, Eric and Lydia wanted to meet up with one of Lydia's friends on our way to
			the park.  So we ended up staying at Eric and Lydia's hotel to wait for Bruce and Kelsey, while
			Eric and Lydia went off to meet up with their friends.  I believe it was 12:30 pm before we
			ever all got to Mesa Verde.</td>

		    After a brief visit at just one of the sites.  We found a place to have a picnic lunch.
		    <P>
			After lunch (I think it was about 3:30 pm), we all went our separate ways.  Eric and Lydia went back to
			their hotel and Grandma and Grandpa Hatch came with us to visit the Four Corners Monument before returning
			to Bloomfield.</td>

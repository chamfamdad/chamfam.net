Last September Uncle Bryan came to watch the boys so that Fletcher and Marie could take a trip.  They visited Nauvoo, Illinois where the <a href="http://www.mormon.org/">Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints</a> had just completed building a new <a href="http://www.lds.org/temples/main/0,11204,1912-1-160-0,00.html">temple</a>.  On their way they took a wrong turn and ending up driving through Pekin, Illinois.  In
the middle of town they discoverd the <a href="http://www.pekin.net/sundial/index.html">world's greatest sundial</a>.

So, since the whole family was going to be visiting Nauvoo, we decided to take the boys to see the sundial.  There is a park across
the street from the sundial where we stopped to have lunch.  Then we went to explore the sundial.

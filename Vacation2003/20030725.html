			On the way to the zoo we stopped at a grocery store to buy food and snacks for lunch.
			<P>
			At the zoo, Grandma Hatch passed out little fans with squirt bottles on them so that the kids could
			keep cool.  They ended up spraying water on everyone and everything in the park.  No one seemed to mind
			because it was 97 degrees.</td>

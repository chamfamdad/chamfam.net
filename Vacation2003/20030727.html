		    There are three wards in Bloomfield, and Marie was hoping to see people in
		    each of the three wards.  So she got ready and went to church earlier than
			the rest of us.
			<P>
			Fletcher stayed with the boys to help get them get ready to go to Grandma and
		    Granpa's ward at 1:00 pm.</td>

		    Attended church with Grandma and Grandpa.
		    <P>
		    After church we took the camper to the KOA, which was now nearly deserted, and then
		    went to see Bruce and Kelsey's new home.  They are very close to the high school where
		    Bruce teaches (and coaches football).

			Got up this morning and talked to our bank.  This will be the first time we have ever
			borrowed money for a car.  We don't like the idea.  We have always lived so that if we
			didn't have the money, we wouldn't buy it.  But now we are stuck in Kansas.  It would be
			unwise to spend money and time to fix the current van.  It would also be unwise to rent
			a van for the next two weeks.  We might as well use that money for the new van.  So we
			have decided to go ahead and borrow money for the new van.  We will hopefully have
			it paid off much sooner than the loan will expect.

			we plan to purchase his van.  He says he will get it in for the work we agreed to (alignment and
			third brake light) and that it should be ready by about 10:00 to 10:30 am.

			We are done with the paper work, signed the loan, etc. but the new van is not ready yet.  It
			seems they haven't even started yet.  As soon as they get back from lunch they will get right on it.
			So we go and find something to eat.

		<td>We drive to the Olathe Ford RV Center (another 30 miles or so the wrong way) to get an adapter for the
		trailer.  They are absolutely no help whatsover.  Their salesman seemed like he just didn't want to be bothered
		by me.  There was no way he was going to help me find what I needed.  I tried to explain the type of connector
		I had, but I didn't know what I was talking about.  He could have walked the 20 feet to the van and looked
		himself, but he didn't want to be bothered.  But, after searching their store on my own, and some trial
		and error, I finally find the right adapter.
